# Asynchronous programming in Shiny

This repo contains examples to implement asynchronous programming in Shiny âœ¨ 

Async programming can sound very daunting but by providing specific Shiny examples the aim is to speed up the learning curve.

## About asynchronous programming

Asynchronous programming allows for the execution of multiple tasks concurrently, improving the performance and responsiveness of Shiny applications. Traditional synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, which can result in slower response times and blocked resources. By default, a Shiny applications runs on a single-threaded synchronous R session.

Asynchronous programming in Shiny can be achieved through various packages that provide mechanisms for running code concurrently, such as [promises](https://github.com/rstudio/promises/), [callr](https://github.com/r-lib/callr/), and [coro](https://github.com/r-lib/coro). These packages allow developers to write more efficient and responsive code.

## Examples

* **promises**: under construction ðŸš§ 
* **callr**: two examples that show how to spin up background R processes. The basic example runs a long computation in the background, and the markdown example knits a markdown document in the background.
* **coro**: under construction ðŸš§ 

## Future plans

The plan is to add more examples and tutorials on how to implement asynchronous programming in Shiny. Keep an eye on this repository for updates.
